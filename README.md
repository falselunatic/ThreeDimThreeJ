# Three.js 3D Scene with Rotating Box, Two Rotating Spheres, and Grid
(I'm just learning & exploring)

This project is a basic 3D scene built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), featuring a rotating box, a plane, a sphere, a grid helper, and interactive camera controls using `OrbitControls`. The scene includes visual aids such as an axes helper and grid to enhance orientation within the 3D environment.

## Features
- **3D Rotating Box**: A green cube that rotates continuously along the X and Y axes.
- **3D Sphere**: A blue sphere positioned above the plane.
- **Plane**: A white plane that serves as the ground, aligned along the XZ plane.
- **Grid Helper**: A grid that overlays the plane for better spatial orientation.
- **Axes Helper**: Shows the X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue) axes to provide a reference point in the scene.
- **Orbit Controls**: Enables interactive camera control with mouse (rotation, zoom, and pan).

## Demo
Hereâ€™s what the 3D scene looks like:

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A local development server like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` (or the default port for your development server).

## Controls
- **Mouse**: Rotate, zoom, and pan the camera using the mouse.
- **Keyboard**: Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys for navigation.

## Code Overview
- `WebGLRenderer`: Sets up the rendering context and attaches it to the HTML document.
- `PerspectiveCamera`: A 3D perspective camera for viewing the scene.
- `OrbitControls`: Enables user interaction with the camera.
- `BoxGeometry`, `PlaneGeometry`, and `SphereGeometry`: The 3D objects in the scene, including a rotating box, a static sphere, and a plane.
- `AxesHelper` and `GridHelper`: Visual aids for orientation and structure in the 3D scene.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more 3D objects such as pyramids or toruses.
- Implementing dynamic lighting for improved realism.
- Adding textures to the objects for better visual detail.
